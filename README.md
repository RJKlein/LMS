NOTE: working on creating local build parameters for Postgress!!!(again) currently 
built for Heroku only. 

LOCAL BUILD STEPS TBD

If you clone the project run 'npm install' from command line to pull all of Node requirements.
Use 'npm Start' to run locally.

A local Postgress install is required run '../node_modules/bin/sequelize db:migrate' from the server folder
